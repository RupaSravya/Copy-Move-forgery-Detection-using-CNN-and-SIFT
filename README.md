Images play a crucial role\cite{1} in various fields like medicine, education, digital forensics, sports, research, surveillance, and news media.
They serve as primary sources of information. The accessibility of affordable and open-source image editing software such as Photoshop, Paint Shop, Photo-plus, GIMP, and Coral Draw has made it effortless to create manipulated images. 
These advanced tools have made it difficult to distinguish between an authentic image and an altered one with the naked eye. 
The process of creating manipulated images by altering original image data is known as digital image forgery. Detecting such forgery can be approached actively or passively.

Copy-move forgery involves duplicating and repositioning image segments, posing challenges for detection.
Traditional methods use key-point features or block-level alignment but struggle with complexity. 
Adaptive over-segmentation divides images into patches, reducing computational load for feature matching.
